## Game of Thrones Death Quiz

You will be asked a series of questions. To answer the question you must know which GoT character died after or before whom. There are two options. As long as you keep answering correctly your streak will keep rising. One wrong answer and its GAME OVER!

Let's see what the longest streak you can achieve.

## Local Setup

* Install serve globally with `npm install -g serve`.
